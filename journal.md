# Weekly Reflections
## Week 1
+ Held our first meeting Wednesday night to write our team resume and discuss potential project ideas. We discussed how 
we will be communicating and set up Discord to talk through channels there. We decided to meet via Zoom, and chose 
Wednesday and Sunday nights. We created the repo in GitHub and everyone cloned the project.
+ After meeting and giving some time to individually think about proposed project ideas, we decided what to build. John 
drafted the problem statement, Erik drafted the tools and technology list used, and Alivia drafted the team charter, and
we got together on Sunday to review our drafts and finalize.

## Week 2
+ Met Wednesday night to discuss feedback on week 1 submission and how to incorporate into the project. We also 
discussed first steps and how to divvy up work for the week.
+ Created project structure & started journal - Alivia
